    <h3>A Battleship, With Wagyu</h3>
    <p>Gunkan, or gunkanmaki, Japanese for "battleship" because of their appearance, are a unique type of sushi. 
        Gunkan are hand-formed oval clumps of sushi rice with a strip of pressed seaweed around the outside to contain 
        the ingredients — traditionally salmon eggs, sea urchin (a delight if you're never tried it) or broiled eel, 
        sometimes with a quail egg yolk on top. Famed NYC sushi haven SUSHISAMBA took this traditional Japanese concept 
        and came up with a way to have your raw steak and eat it, too.</p>
    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>2 ounces sushi rice</li>
            <li>4 strips nori (pressed seaweed sheets)/li>
            <li>4 quail eggs</li>
            <li>4 ounces wagyu (ribeye preferred)</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons soy sauce</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons freshly squeezed lemon juice</li>
            <li>a dash of extra virgin olive oil</li>
            <li>salt</li>
            <li>chopped chives</li>
            <li>potato sticks</li>
        </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Divide rice (try our easy sushi rice recipe) into 4 portions and, using your hands, form small mounds 1" tall by 2" wide.</li>
            <li>Wrap a strip of nori around the circumference of each mound, leaving plenty of room on top for the nori to contain the filling.</li>
            <li>In a medium bowl, mix the wagyu, chives, soy sauce, lemon juice, olive oil and salt.</li>
            <li>Place 1/4 of the wagyu mixture on each piece of sushi.</li>
            <li>Top each with a quail egg yolk, potato sticks, chopped chives and sprinkle of sea salt.</li>
        </ol>
