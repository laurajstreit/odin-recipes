    <h3>How To Make the Perfect Pan Seared Steak</h3>
    <p>This classic is key to becoming a proficient chef. Learn how to pan sear steak to absolute perfection!</p>
    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>1 lb of Top Sirloin Steak</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon black pepper</li>
            <li>Â¾ teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>nob of butter</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons of garlic powder</li>
            <li>2 rosemary sprigs</li>
            <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>kosher salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
        </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Pat dry: use paper towels to pat the steaks dry to get a perfect sear and reduce oil splatter.</li>
            <li>Season generously: just before cooking steaks, sprinkle both sides liberally with salt and pepper.</li>
            <li>Preheat the pan on medium and brush with oil. Using just 1/2 Tbsp oil reduces splatter.</li>
            <li>Sear steaks: add steaks and sear each side 3-4 minutes until a brown crust has formed then use tongs to turn steaks on their sides and sear edges (1 min per edge).</li>
            <li>Add butter and aromatics: melt in butter with quartered garlic cloves and rosemary sprigs. Tilt pan to spoon garlic butter over steaks and cook to your desired doneness (see chart below).</li>
            <li>Remove steak and rest 10 minutes before slicing against the grain.</li>
        </ol>
